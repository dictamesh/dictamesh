This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Violations

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior.

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Duration**: Typically 30-90 days, depending on severity.

**Example Scenarios**:
